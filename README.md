# Text-entailment-
The project aims to take input as paragraphs/text and extract problem statements from junk. The logic followed is that problem statements , though scattered , together create one meaningful text slab. We beleive the problem statement to have negative inclination and hence we use sentiment analysis to segregate the negative groups.  We use ALLENNLP TEXT ENTAILMENT to group together the problem Statements. We then treat group elements  We then Use ALLENNLP Sentiment Analysis to label the groups as postive or negative.
